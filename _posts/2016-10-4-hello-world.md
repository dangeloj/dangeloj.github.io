Welcome to [my personal blog](http://blog.thegeeko.com)! Thank you for checking it out.

### What to expect from this blog

This is a place for me to write out my thoughts and opinions on softare development,
running and building a company, and being a human. I like learning new things, new
programming languages, new ways of solving problems, about how people interact,
and how to be a better person.

### Programming

I love programming. I love building. I love creating useable software. My current view
on programming languages is that they are just tools. Of course, some tools are more
enjoyable to use that others.

I have spent a fair amount of time writing F#, C#, and living in the .NET ecosystem.
Most of that time has been spent working on web applications, writing HTTP APIs,
and handfuls of single-page applications (SPAs). I have also been spending a good
chunk of time learning Rust for a change of pace. Overall, I enjoy functional programming
styles and continue to learn concepts that are abstract from languages.

### Business

I am currently building [Funclobile](http://www.funclobile.com) (fun-clo-bull), a software consultancy.
My goal here is to create a company that empowers people. I truly believe that businesses exist for
humans and not the other way around. Using the power of business to enrich the lives of everybody
who interacts with the company is what we're all about.

If you'd like to join me, I'd love to chat! If you need help on a project, have an application you need written,
or just need an outsider's point of view, [reach out](mailto:jim@funclobile.com) and let's see how we
can work together.

### Humanity

Being a human is hard. I'm fortunate that I'm not hindered by my skin color, sexual orientation, or
religious beliefs. I know that others around me are not so fortunate. I choose, therefore, to use
this as a place to discuss how we can better ourselves, empower the disenfranchised, and gain a
different perspective on life. I think listening is just as important and want to hear your story as
well! Please share your thoughts, your ideas, your concerns with me.
