Happy Veteran's day to all my fellow veterans who have served and are currently serving.

### USAF

I don't tend to write or share much about my time in the military, but it is a time in my life
when I grew and really learned a lot about myself and what it means to be an American. I spent
just short of seven year in the United States Air Force as an enlisted Air Traffic Controller.
(Not the people who wave cones at airplanes on the ground.) I got to spend time all over the US,
three years in Japan, and served a tour in Iraq.

### Veterans

I don't post this in search of praise, but rather to ask when you celebrate Veteran's Day to really
think about those that are serving and those that have served. Remember that fireworks, parties,
and other acts of celebration can actually trigger PTSD and otherwise cause mental strain for those
who have served.

Please be considerate and ask them what they think about celebrating, what their service meant to them,
and just listen. I think we, as Americans, use this time (and a lot of other holidays) in a way that
we think is appropriate without stopping to ask those we're trying to honor how they feel about it.

### Thank you

Thank you, again, to all of those that are currently serving their country, and those that have served.
Especially those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.
